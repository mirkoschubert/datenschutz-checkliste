This **Data Protection Cheat Sheet** cannot address individual cases and does **not constitute legal advice**, but is merely a collection of knowledge compiled from extensive research, own experience and "best practices" of various developers and is constantly being further developed. We assume **no liability** and recommend to consult a lawyer for legal questions in any case.
