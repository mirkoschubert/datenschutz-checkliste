This **Data Protection Cheat Sheet** is intended to serve as a general orientation for web designers and developers as well as, of course, for every interested website operator in order to prepare websites and commissioned works in accordance with currently valid German and European law.

Peter and I have taken the knowledge we have gathered over the past few months on the occasion of the GDPR and developed this list. It is still "work-in-progress" - currently I am, for example, searching for the relevant legal bases, judgments and statements / articles of lawyers. We also invite everyone to [contribute](https://github.com/mirkoschubert/datenschutz-checkliste#du-m√∂chtest-gerne-mitwirken) via this Github repository .

### Disclaimer

The **Data Protection Checklist** cannot address individual cases and does **not constitute legal advice**, but is merely a collection of knowledge that has been compiled from extensive research, our own experience and "best practices" of various developers and is constantly being further developed. We assume **no liability** and recommend to consult a lawyer for legal questions in any case.
